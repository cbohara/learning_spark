Apache Spark philosophy
	unified
		wide variety of operations
			simple as loading data and querying using SQL
			complicated as using machine learning
		for example
			you can load data in using SQL
			then evaluate a machine learning model over the data
			spark can combine these steps into one scan over the data
	computing engine
		only responsible for performing computations
		not for storage
		works with a variety of data sources
	libraries
		provide a unified API for common data analysis tasks
		2 sets of APIs
			low level "unstructured" APIs
			high level Structured APIs

Basic Architecture
	manage and coordinate execution of tasks on data across a cluster of computers
	we submit Spark apps to cluster managers > grant resources to app to do work
	cluster manager
		controls physical machines
		allocates resources to Spark app

Spark App
	driver process
		runs main() function
		sits on a node in the cluster
		responsible for
			maintaining info about Spark app
			responding to user/program input
			analyzing distributing and scheduling work across executors
		driver can be "driven" from a number of different languages via Spark's language APIs
		control Spark app through driver process
	executor processes
		executes code assigned to it by the driver
		reporting state of computation back to the driver node
		almost always running Spark scala code

SparkSession
	driver process manifests itself to the user as a SparkSession object
	entrance point to running Spark code
		1-to-1 correspondence b/w SparkSession and Spark app
	interactive Spark session
		./bin/spark-shell
		./bin/pyspark
		implicitly create SparkSession in interactive mode
	submit precompiled application to Spark engine
		spark-submit

DataFrame
	represents a table of data with rows and columns
	distributed collection = exists on multiple machines
	best to use DataFrame over Datasets, SQL Tables, and RDDs
	available in all languages

Partitions
	Spark breaks data up into chunks = partitions
	partition = collection of rows that sit on one physical machine in our cluster
	parallelism of 1
		only 1 partition
			even if you have thousands of executors available
			data is only available in 1 chunk
		only 1 executor
			even if you have multiple partitions
			only 1 computational resource
	with DF
		do not manipulate partitions manually
		specify high level transformations of data > Spark determines how to split data

Transformations
	core data structures are immutable
	specify how you want a DF to change to get the resulting DF
	lazy evaluation
	2 types of transformations
		narrow transformations = narrow dependency
			input partition will contribute to only 1 output partition
			1 DF > 1 DF
			pipelining
				specify multiple filters on DF for a transformation
				all filters performed in memory
		wide transformation = wide dependency
			input partitions contribute to many output partitions
			shuffle
				exchange partitions across the cluster
				Spark will write results to disk

Lazy Evalution
	Spark will wait until the very last moment to execute the graph of computation instructions
	predicate pushdown
		Spark can optimize the entire data flow from end to end
		for example
			build a large spark job and then
			the last filter only requires to fetch 1 row from source data >
			only access the single record we need

Action
	trigger the computation
	instructs Spark to compute a result from a series of transformations
	3 types
		view data in the console
		collect data to native objects
		write to output data sources

End-to-End Example
	use DataFrame reader assoc with SparkSession to read in data
		schema inference = ask Spark to figure out schema
		header = true specifies first row is a header not data
	each resulting DataFrame has a set of columns with unspecified # of rows
		reading data = transformation = lazy evaluation
		Spark only took a peek at a couple rows to guess schema
	explain()
		usedful for debugging
		top - end result
		bottom - data sources
	shuffle partitions
		by default Spark will output 200 shuffle partitions
		overkill for this example
		spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "5")

DataFrames and SQL
	 no performance difference between writing SQL queries or writing DataFrame code
	allows you to query data using SQL
	createOrReplaceTempView
		make DataFrame into a table or view
